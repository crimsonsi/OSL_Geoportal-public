          24.1. Oakar Services will rely only on the written Terms and
          Conditions. Any representations, statements or agreements made or
          entered into elsewhere, whether directly or indirectly, written or
          oral or in advertising are not binding towards Oakar Services unless

          <br></br> <br></br>
          24.3. If Oakar Services does not exercise or enforce any legal right
          or remedy which is set out in this Agreement or which Kenya Space
          Agency has the benefit of under any applicable law, this will not be
          construed as a formal waiver of Oakar Services's rights or remedies
          and such rights or remedies will remain available to Kenya Space
          Agency.
          <br></br> <br></br>
          24.4. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid,
          illegal or unenforceable (in whole or in part) as determined by a
          court of law having jurisdiction to decide on this matter, the
          validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions
          shall not in any way be affected or impaired.
          <br></br> <br></br>
          24.5. Each of the Oakar Services's Subsidiaries shall be a third party
          beneficiary to the Agreement and shall be entitled to directly enforce
          and rely upon any provision of this Agreement which confers a benefit
          on (or rights in favor of) them. Subject to the foregoing, no other
          person shall be a third party beneficiary to this Agreement.
          <br></br> <br></br>
          24.6. You are not permitted to transfer, assign or otherwise dispose
          of this Agreement which is personal to You, or any of Your rights or
          obligations arising under this Agreement without the prior written
          consent of Oakar Services.
          <br></br> <br></br>
          24.7. This Agreement and Your relationship with Oakar Services under
          this Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the
          laws of the jurisdiction where You are resident, without regard to its
          conflict of law provisions and subject to the non-exclusive
          jurisdiction of the courts of such jurisdiction, to resolve any legal
          matter arising in relation to the Agreement. Notwithstanding the
          foregoing, Oakar Services may apply for injunctive remedies (or an
