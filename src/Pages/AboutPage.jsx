            The Geoportal is our one stop platform that allows you to access,
            visualize and analyze our collections of data. The portal helps our
            users save time by availing useful, relevant and easy to understand
            sets of data. It also provides spatial data analysis and
            visualization (also known as GIS) capabilities. <br />
            <br /> By availing data remotely through this portal, we have
            facilitated institutions and individuals to save time and
            operational costs taken to access and set up data locally as would
            be the case in an analogue setup. <br />
            We invite you to explore . . .
